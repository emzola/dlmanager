# dlmanager

dlmanager is an HTTP client for downloading files from the internet. It has the following features:

- Supports single and multiple file downloads concurrently
- Supports downloading urls from file
- Saves downloaded files to a given location (directory). If the given directory path does not exist, it creates all the missing directories in the path. If a directory is not specified, it uses the projectâ€™s download directory
- Resumable downloads after connection failure
- Keeps track of download progress concurrently
